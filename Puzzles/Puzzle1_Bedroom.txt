Bedroom w/Bathroom

Goal: Find a way to exit the room

Starting conditions:
	Hallway door locked
	Bathroom door locked
	Computer password locked
	Desk bottom drawer locked
	Fusebox closed, no known way to open.

1. Desk drawer has key to bathroom, note on bathroom door hints to key location.
2. Once in bathroom, another note on shower door gives hint towards how to find another piece of the puzzle.
	Note: Something is wrong with the shower, no matter what you set it to, the water comes out scalding! I will 
	schedule repairs and leave this note for anyone who might think its a good idea to take a shower.
3. Once the shower is turned on and some time passes, the bathroom will fog up from the shower steam and the password to the computer will appear on the mirror.
4. When you log into the computer a file type note will inform you of the tools and wiring in the bottom drawer and the location of the combination to the bottom drawer. 
5. The combination to the bottom drawer is actually under the keyboard, but you can't interact with the keyboard until reading the computer document.
5. Once you open the bottom drawer, you can use the tools to tamper with the fusebox and open the electronic door.
