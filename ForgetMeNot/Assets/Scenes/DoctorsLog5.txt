I've decided to try and help Nino, without giving myself away. I did some tinkering with the fuse box in his room, he should be able to escape if he cuts the right wire. But to get the wirecutter he will need the combination from the computer. I left the administrator password for the computer in the bathroom in the mirror. Luckily no one ever fixed the shower, so the hot water should allow him to see it. After he gets into the computer he should be able to find the combination to the bottom drawer of the desk. There he will find the tools... They should allow Nino to escape the bedroom at least. I could'nt do much about the security outside the room... Nino will have to figure that out himself.
