The new surveillance room lock has been installed, users with the right clearances can get in normally but others will have to insert both security orbs to release the lock. Luckily the gas will be released if someone takes an orb. Dr. Mckenzie thinks that this is a bad design choice but I think its funny. Who would be dumb enough to take one of the orbs?
