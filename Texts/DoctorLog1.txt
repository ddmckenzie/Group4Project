The purpose of our experiments here is to figure out how to transplant a synthetic brain into a human. Our methods in the past were... inhumane. But despite those dark times, this new subject nino shows promise. The brain was transplanted successfully and he performs daily tasks like normal. Only problem is it works too well... we think hes starting to remember things in his subconcious. He might try to escape.
