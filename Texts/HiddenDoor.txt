Weve hidden the red security orb in the subjects room, Dr. Mallory said that we should put it somewhere else, but its perfectly hidden! I think the best place to hide something is right in plain sight! I've never seen a better secret wall. When I look to my left I can't even see theres a wall. Note: I had to record this log in the subjects room. He's sleeping right now but I'll make sure he doesn't know someone else was here.
